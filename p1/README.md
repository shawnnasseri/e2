I did a few games, but could not get them to load as I am out side the country for a 
trip.  This last simple game was just guess a number between 1 to 20 with a 100 count loop.  I have been travelling for work a bit more than I thought. Usually I get ok internet, but here the internet is worst than a 9600 baud modem. 

The files are also seprated to follow MVC format. In this case a View and Controller. Php code does a loop to 100
guessing the randome number generated between 1 and 20.  The loop will go to 100 unless the correct guess is made to 
the other random genrated number.  The loop will break out if correct guess is guessed. I did add css to the view.
